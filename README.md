# WeatherMine

## Project Description
This project features a weather app that functions through an API response from AccuWeather and outputs the result via an aesthetic GUI. It primarily makes use of object oriented programming which includes classes, and some basic inheritance for the GUI elements alongside deserialization of data and some basic web scraping.

## Installation
After installing Python 3.x.x or later, and downloading the WeatherMine folder and requirements.txt, in your terminal, execute:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Warnings
Currently we are limited to only 25 API calls per day, so the app may not work once the limit for the day has been exceeded, but we hope to resolve this in the future.
